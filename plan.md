# Detailed Implementation Plan for Chat Box Feature

## 1. Create a New Chat Box Component
- **File:** Create a new file at `src/components/ui/chat-box.tsx`.
- **Purpose:** This component will render the conversation view, maintain the list of messages, and manage swipe actions and deletion.

## 2. Define the Message Data Structure
- **Interface:** Define a TypeScript interface for a message with the following properties:
  - `id: string` – Unique identifier.
  - `text: string` – Message content.
  - `sender: "sender" | "receiver"` – Indicates which user sent the message.
  - `isSwiped: boolean` – Flag to determine if the delete option is revealed.
- **Error Handling:** Validate that each message object contains the required fields to prevent runtime errors.

## 3. Set Up Component State and Initial Messages
- **State Management:** Use React’s `useState` hook in the ChatBox component to store an array of messages.
  - Initialize with two messages: one from the sender (first message) and one from the receiver (response).
- **UX Consideration:** Ensure that messages are displayed in chronological order.

## 4. Implement the MessageItem Sub-Component
- **Purpose:** Encapsulate logic for rendering an individual message bubble and handling swipe events.
- **Event Handlers:**
  - **Touch Events:** Implement `onTouchStart`, `onTouchMove`, and `onTouchEnd` events.
  - **Mouse Events:** For desktop testing, add equivalent `onMouseDown`, `onMouseMove`, and `onMouseUp` events.
- **Swipe Logic:**
  - Record the initial X position on touch/mouse down.
  - Calculate the horizontal delta; if the swipe is leftward and exceeds a threshold (e.g. 50px), update the message’s `isSwiped` state.
  - Reset the swipe if the action is canceled.
- **Error Handling:** Check that swipe events compute valid numbers and guard against undefined event properties.

## 5. Design UI Elements for Chat Bubbles and Delete Option
- **Message Bubbles:**
  - Use a flex layout to align messages: sender messages could be left-aligned and receiver messages right-aligned (or vice versa based on your design).
  - Apply modern typography, spacing, and colors (e.g., light blue for sender, light grey for receiver).
- **Delete Icon & Button:**
  - Do not use any external icon libraries; instead, create a simple “X” styled using CSS (or plain text with bold styling) to act as the icon.
  - The delete button (with a label like “Delete”) should be positioned adjacent to the delete icon.
  - These UI elements are made visible only when the message’s `isSwiped` flag is true.
  - Use CSS transitions/animations for a smooth slide-in effect on swipe.
- **Responsiveness:** Ensure the UI scales appropriately on mobile (touch events) and desktop.

## 6. Implement Message Deletion
- **Action Flow:**
  - Once the delete icon/button is visible (after a left swipe), a click event on the delete button should trigger a callback that removes the message from the state.
  - Before deletion, the delete option must be clearly visible so the user can cancel or confirm.
- **Error Handling:** Confirm that the target message exists in state before deletion and handle any null or undefined values gracefully.

## 7. CSS and Global Styling Considerations
- **Globals:** Optionally update `src/app/globals.css` to add additional classes for chat layout, transition effects, and responsive design.
- **Best Practices:** Use semantic element naming and ensure proper spacing, margins, and padding for readability.
- **Accessibility:** Add ARIA labels on the delete button (e.g., `aria-label="Delete message"`) for better accessibility.

## 8. Integration and Testing
- **Integration:** Import and render `ChatBox` in the appropriate parent component or page (e.g., `src/app/page.tsx`) for demonstration.
- **Testing:**
  - Manually test by simulating touch/mouse swipe actions to ensure the delete panel reveals correctly.
  - Verify that clicking the delete button properly removes the message from the chat without UI glitches.
  - Test on both desktop and mobile browsers for consistency.

## 9. Best Practices and Final Checks
- **Error Handling:** Add try-catch or conditional checks where necessary, especially around event coordinates.
- **Code Readability:** Use descriptive variable names and include inline comments explaining the swipe logic.
- **Modularity:** Keep the swipe logic modular within the MessageItem component for easy maintenance.

# Summary
- Created a new ChatBox component in `src/components/ui/chat-box.tsx` using TypeScript.
- Defined a message interface with properties (`id`, `text`, `sender`, `isSwiped`) for state management.
- Implemented a MessageItem sub-component that detects left swipe via touch and mouse events to reveal delete options.
- Designed modern, clean message bubbles with conditional rendering for the delete icon (“X”) and button.
- Ensured state updates and error handling are in place for reliable deletion functionality.
- Integrated the ChatBox into the existing codebase with considerations for responsive design and accessibility.
