## âœ… COMPLETED TASKS

### 1. Project Configuration
- [x] Created `build.gradle` (project level) with Kotlin and Android Gradle plugin
- [x] Created `settings.gradle` with project configuration
- [x] Created `app/build.gradle` with dependencies (RecyclerView, Material Design)
- [x] Created `app/proguard-rules.pro` for code obfuscation rules
- [x] Created `AndroidManifest.xml` with MainActivity configuration

### 2. Resources and Styling
- [x] Created `strings.xml` with app strings and labels
- [x] Created `colors.xml` with chat-specific color palette
- [x] Created `themes.xml` with Material Design theme
- [x] Created `bg_message_sender.xml` drawable for sender message bubbles

### 3. Layout Files
- [x] Created `activity_main.xml` with header and RecyclerView
- [x] Created `item_message_sender.xml` for sender message layout with delete options
- [x] Created `item_message_receiver.xml` for receiver message layout with delete options

### 4. Kotlin Classes
- [x] Created `Message.kt` data class with id, text, sender, and swipe state
- [x] Created `MessageSender` enum for SENDER/RECEIVER types
- [x] Created `ChatAdapter.kt` with:
  - ViewHolder pattern for sender/receiver messages
  - Touch event handling for swipe detection
  - Delete button visibility management
  - Message deletion callback
- [x] Created `MainActivity.kt` with:

  - Initial message loading (alternating sender/receiver)
  - Message deletion functionality

### 5. Core Features Implementation
- [x] **Two User System**: Sender and Receiver with distinct UI styling
- [x] **Alternating Messages**: Initial messages start with sender, then receiver
- [x] **Left Swipe Detection**: Touch event handling with 100px threshold
- [x] **Delete UI**: Shows delete icon (âœ•) and delete button after swipe
- [x] **Message Deletion**: Removes message from list and updates UI
- [x] **Right Swipe**: Hides delete options without deleting

### 6. UI/UX Features
- [x] Modern chat bubble design with rounded corners
- [x] Different styling for sender (blue) and receiver (gray) messages
- [x] Responsive layout that works on different screen sizes
- [x] Smooth animations and state management
- [x] User-friendly instructions at bottom of screen

### 7. Documentation
- [x] Created comprehensive `README.md` with:
  - Feature overview
  - Usage instructions
  - Technical implementation details
  - Project structure
  - Installation guide

## ðŸŽ¯ FEATURE VERIFICATION

### âœ… Requirement 1: Create 2 user sender and receiver
- Implemented with `MessageSender` enum (SENDER/RECEIVER)
- Distinct UI layouts and styling for each user type
- Clear visual differentiation in message alignment and colors

### âœ… Requirement 2: First sender send message after receiver send message
- Initial messages loaded in alternating pattern
- Sample conversation demonstrates sender â†’ receiver â†’ sender flow
- 6 sample messages showing proper alternation

### âœ… Requirement 3: When left swipe a message, message gets deleted
- Touch event detection with horizontal swipe calculation
- Left swipe threshold of 100px to prevent accidental triggers
- Message removal from list with proper UI updates

### âœ… Requirement 4: Show delete icon and button after swipe but before deletion
- Delete container with icon (âœ•) and "Delete" button
- Appears only after successful left swipe detection
- Both icon and button trigger deletion when clicked
- Can be hidden by right swipe without deleting

## ðŸ“± READY FOR TESTING

The Android chat app is now complete and ready for testing. All core requirements have been implemented:

1. **Functional Chat Interface**: Two-user system with proper message flow
2. **Swipe Gestures**: Left swipe reveals delete options, right swipe hides them
3. **Delete Functionality**: Clear visual feedback before actual deletion
4. **Modern UI**: Clean, responsive design following Material Design principles

To test the app:
1. Import project into Android Studio
2. Sync Gradle files
3. Run on emulator or physical device
4. Test swipe gestures on different messages
5. Verify delete functionality works as expected

All files are properly structured and follow Android development best practices.
